# ARCoM
FYP Project - Augmented Reality based Condition Monitoring System for Gearboxes

- ARCoM is an integrated failure prediction, failure visualisation and maintenance Android mobile application developed as part of my National University of Singapore (NUS) Final Year Project.

- This is a mobile Android application which is most suited to run on smartphones or tablets with large screen size.

- Most user interactions occur via the touch screen interface and require a set-up of a machinery in operation and a target image tracker.

- This README file is best viewed via GitHub (https://github.com/daredevil999/ARCoM)
